This repository contains R scripts which analyse data from
The Cancer Genome Atlas, specifically Breast invasive carcinoma. 
Data is available for download at https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/

Installation: 
  git clone https://arnijohnsen@bitbucket.org/arnijohnsen/cancerdata.git
  mkdir rawdata
  mkdir Rdata

The Rscripts rely on the following packages:
  WGCNA

The data sets used are Methylation, RNA squencing and clinical data, 
which should be placed in a directory
  ../rawdata/
relative to where the source code was cloned. 
This directory should also contain a subdirectory with probe
annotation files, ../rawdata/AnnotationFiles/

Scripts found in convertRawData/ convert this data to .Rdata files, 
which are saved in to a directory called
  ../Rdata/

Data files from TCGA must be extracted using tar, prior to execution. 

A sample file structure looks as follows: 

|____cancerdata
| |____convertRawData
|____rawdata
| |____RNASeq
| | |____METADATA
| | | |____UNC__IlluminaHiSeq_RNASeq
| | |____RNASeq
| | | |____UNC__IlluminaHiSeq_RNASeq     : Raw RNA sequencing data files
| | | | |____Level_3
| |____Methylation
| | |____METADATA
| | | |____JHU_USC__HumanMethylation450
| | |____DNA_Methylation
| | | |____JHU_USC__HumanMethylation450  : Raw DNA methylation data files
| | | | |____Level_3
| |____Clinical
| | |____Clinical
| | | |____Biotab                        : Clinical data
| | | |____XML
| |____AnnotationFiles                   : Probe annotation files
|____Rdata
